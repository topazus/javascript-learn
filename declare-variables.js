// Variables declared by let have their scope in the block for which they are
//  declared, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way, let works very
//   much like var. The main difference is that the scope of a var variable is the
//   entire enclosing function:
function varTest() {
  var x = 1
  {
    var x = 2 // same variable!
    console.log(x) // 2
  }
  console.log(x) // 2
}

function letTest() {
  let x = 1
  {
    let x = 2 // different variable
    console.log(x) // 2
  }
  console.log(x) // 1
}

// At the top level of programs and functions, let, unlike var, does not create
// a property on the global object.

var x = "global"
let y = "global"
console.log(this.x) // "global"
console.log(this.y) // undefined
